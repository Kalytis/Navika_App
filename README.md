## Needed
### Flutter
Before you begin, make sure you have Flutter installed: [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

## Installation
### Here
You also need the Here SDK (for maps); the documentation is here: [SDK for Flutter Explore Edition](https://www.here.com/docs/bundle/sdk-for-flutter-explore-developer-guide/page/README.html), and it can be downloaded here: [Here Platform](https://platform.here.com/portal/sdk).
\
Next, place the SDK in the `plugins/here_sdk` folder and add your HERE credentials to `lib/src/data/credentials.dart`.

### Firebase
The last step is to add Firebase (for notifications and crash analytics). Follow the instructions here: [Add Firebase to your Flutter app](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?hl=fr&authuser=0&platform=ios) and add your credentials to `lib/src/data/credentials.dart`.
\
Don't forget to place `google-services.json` file in `android/app`.

*Note: By making some modifications, especially in `lib/main.dart`, it is possible to omit Firebase.*
